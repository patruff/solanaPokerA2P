# ðŸš¨ INSTALLATION ISSUE FIXED ðŸš¨

## Problem
You encountered this error when trying to install Solana CLI:
```
curl: (35) LibreSSL SSL_connect: SSL_ERROR_SYSCALL in connection to release.solana.com:443
```

## Solution - Use Homebrew Instead!

The easiest and most reliable way to install Solana on macOS:

```bash
brew install solana
```

That's it! Then verify:
```bash
solana --version
```

## Alternative Methods

If Homebrew doesn't work, I've created a comprehensive guide with 4 different installation methods:

**ðŸ“– See: `SOLANA_INSTALL.md`**

This guide includes:
- âœ… Homebrew installation (recommended)
- âœ… Direct download from GitHub
- âœ… Using wget instead of curl
- âœ… Using npm
- âœ… Troubleshooting for all common errors
- âœ… PATH configuration help

## Quick Test

After installation, test it works:

```bash
# Check version
solana --version

# Configure for devnet
solana config set --url devnet

# Create wallet
solana-keygen new

# Get test SOL
solana airdrop 2

# Check balance
solana balance
```

If all these work, you're ready to continue! ðŸš€

## Updated Documentation

I've updated these files with the new installation instructions:
- âœ… `README.md` - Multiple installation methods
- âœ… `QUICKSTART.md` - Homebrew as primary method
- âœ… `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Updated quick start
- âœ… `CHECKLIST.md` - Installation checklist
- âœ… `SOLANA_INSTALL.md` - **NEW** Comprehensive installation guide

## Next Steps

Once Solana CLI is installed:

1. Continue with `QUICKSTART.md` from step 2
2. Or follow the full `README.md` guide
3. Or use `CHECKLIST.md` to track your progress

## Still Having Issues?

If Homebrew doesn't work either:
1. Check `SOLANA_INSTALL.md` for more methods
2. Try the GitHub direct download method
3. Use Solana Playground (web-based, no installation needed): https://beta.solpg.io

**TL;DR: Run `brew install solana` and you're good to go!** ðŸŽ‰
