# Player Setup Guide

Hey Joe, Phil, and Sarah! üëã

This guide will help you get set up to play Solana Poker. It should take about 10 minutes.

## What You'll Need

- A computer with a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Brave recommended)
- A Google account (you already have one!)
- About 10 minutes

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Install Phantom Wallet (5 minutes)

Phantom is a digital wallet for Solana, like a crypto version of PayPal.

1. **Go to**: https://phantom.app
2. **Click**: "Download" and choose your browser
3. **Install**: The browser extension
4. **Create**: A new wallet (click "Create New Wallet")
5. **IMPORTANT**: Write down your recovery phrase on paper and keep it safe!
   - This is like your password - don't lose it!
   - Don't share it with anyone
   - Store it somewhere secure
6. **Set**: A password for the wallet

‚úÖ You should now see the Phantom icon in your browser toolbar!

### Step 2: Switch to Test Network (1 minute)

We're using test money (not real SOL) to start:

1. **Click**: The Phantom icon in your browser
2. **Click**: Settings (gear icon at bottom)
3. **Click**: "Change Network"
4. **Select**: "Devnet"

‚úÖ You should see "Devnet" at the top of your Phantom wallet!

### Step 3: Get Test SOL (2 minutes)

You need some test SOL to play:

1. **In Phantom**: Click "Receive"
2. **Copy**: Your wallet address (it's a long string of letters and numbers)
3. **Go to**: https://solfaucet.com
4. **Paste**: Your wallet address
5. **Click**: "Devnet" and then "Request Airdrop"
6. **Wait**: A few seconds

‚úÖ You should see 1-2 SOL in your Phantom wallet!

**Alternative method** (if the faucet doesn't work):
- Send me your wallet address
- I'll send you test SOL directly

### Step 4: Join the Game (2 minutes)

1. **Go to**: www.patgpt.us (or the URL I send you)
2. **Click**: "Sign in with Google"
3. **Choose**: Your Google account
4. **Click**: The Phantom button to connect your wallet
5. **Approve**: The connection in Phantom
6. **Enter**: Your name (optional - it'll use your Google name otherwise)
7. **Click**: "Join Game"

‚úÖ You're in! Wait for everyone else to join!

## Important Notes

- It has no real value
- It's just for testing and fun

‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep your recovery phrase safe**
- Write it on paper
- Store it securely
- Never share it with anyone (not even me!)
- If you lose it, you lose access to your wallet

‚ö†Ô∏è **When we switch to real SOL later**
- I'll let you know
- We'll start with very small amounts
- You'll need to buy real SOL (I'll help with this)
