## 🚀 Quick Start (15 Minutes)

### 1. Install Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Solana CLI
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"

# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Verify installations
solana --version
rustc --version
node --version
```

### 2. Configure Solana

```bash
# Set to devnet for testing
solana config set --url devnet

# Create a wallet
solana-keygen new

# Get test SOL
solana airdrop 2
```

### 3. Deploy Smart Contract

```bash
cd solana-poker-dapp/program

# Build
cargo build-bpf

# Deploy
solana program deploy target/deploy/solana_poker.so

# SAVE THE PROGRAM ID!
```

### 4. Configure Frontend

Edit `app/src/utils/solana.ts`:
```typescript
export const POKER_PROGRAM_ID = new PublicKey('YOUR_PROGRAM_ID_HERE');
```

Edit `app/src/utils/firebase.ts`:
```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  // ... other config
};
```

### 5. Run the App

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and play!

## 🎮 How to Play

### For You (Testing)

1. **Solo Testing**:
   - Sign in with Google
   - Connect Phantom wallet
   - Enable "Test Mode" to add a bot
   - Play against the bot

2. **Multi-Wallet Testing**:
   - Create multiple Phantom wallets
   - Open app in different browsers
   - Connect different wallets
   - Play against yourself

### For Your Siblings

Send them `PLAYER_SETUP.md` - it has step-by-step instructions for:
1. Installing Phantom wallet
2. Getting test SOL
3. Joining the game

## 🔧 Configuration Needed

### 1. Firebase Setup (Required for Google Auth)

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Create a new project
3. Enable Google Authentication
4. Get your config and update `app/src/utils/firebase.ts`

### 2. Solana Program ID (Required)

After deploying the smart contract, update:
- `app/src/utils/solana.ts` with your Program ID

### 3. S3 Deployment (Optional)

To deploy to www.patgpt.us:

```bash
cd app
npm run build
aws s3 sync build/ s3://your-bucket-name --delete
```

## 📚 Documentation Guide

- **README.md** - Complete documentation and setup
- **QUICKSTART.md** - Fast 15-minute setup
- **TESTING.md** - How to test with multiple wallets
- **PLAYER_SETUP.md** - Send this to Joe, Phil, and Sarah
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical deep dive

## 🤖 Bot AI Features

The test bot includes:
- Hand strength evaluation
- Pot odds calculation
- Strategic decision making (fold/call/raise)
- Randomness for unpredictability

Perfect for solo testing before your siblings join!

## 🎯 Spectator/AI Agent Support

The spectator seat is designed for future AI integration:
- Can join when player seats are full
- Has its own Phantom wallet
- Can contribute SOL to the pot
- Ready for LLM integration (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Devnet (Testing) - FREE
- All transactions use test SOL
- Unlimited testing

### Mainnet (Real Money)
- Deploy program: ~2-5 SOL (~$200-500)
- Each transaction: ~0.000005 SOL (~$0.0005)
- Very cheap to play!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security
- This is designed for trusted players (family/friends)
- Card dealing is client-side (not verifiable)
- Winner determination is manual
- For public use, add verifiable randomness (Chainlink VRF)

### Testing First
- Always test on Devnet first
- Use test SOL before real money
- Make sure everything works smoothly
- Get comfortable with the interface

### Wallet Safety
- Never share recovery phrases
- Keep them written down safely
- Test wallets are separate from real wallets
- Start with small amounts on mainnet

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Easy to add:
- [ ] Automatic hand evaluation
- [ ] Verifiable random card dealing
- [ ] Multiple simultaneous games
- [ ] Tournament mode
- [ ] Chat functionality
- [ ] Player statistics
- [ ] Leaderboard
- [ ] LLM AI player in spectator seat

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds"
```bash
solana airdrop 2
```

### "Program not found"
- Check Program ID in `solana.ts`
- Verify you're on devnet

### Wallet won't connect
- Install Phantom: https://phantom.app
- Switch to Devnet in Phantom
- Refresh the page
